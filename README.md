# Soccer Match Outcome Prediction

## 1. Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of soccer matches (Home Win, Draw, Away Win) using historical match data, betting odds, and team/player attributes. We will explore data cleaning, feature engineering, and train a baseline model (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression) to assess predictive performance.

## 2. Current Status (Week 1)
- We have just set up this repository. 
- We’re finalizing our project scope and have started planning tasks via the Issue Tracker and Milestones. (first version is done) 
- Data sources are identified, but no major data cleaning or modeling has begun yet.

## 3. Project Goals & Roadmap
- **Short-Term (Week 1–2):**  
  - Consolidate data sources and handle basic cleaning.  
  - Conduct initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  - Outline possible features (form, head-to-head performance, odds, etc.).

- **Mid-Term (Week 2–3):**  
  - Implement feature engineering.  
  - Build an initial baseline model.  
  - Experiment with improved models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

- **Long-Term (Week 4):**  
  - Finalize model tuning and evaluation.  
  - Prepare a demo and finalize documentation.


## 4. Repository Structure
> *Anticipated structure (may evolve over time):*  
- `README.md` – This file  
- `data/` – Raw/cleaned datasets or references to data locations  
- `src/` –  Core source code/scripts  
- `docs/` – All documentation that we have created.

## 5. How to Install & Use (Initial Instructions)
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone XXXX
    ```
    
    - *(Future: Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` once the file is available.)*
2. **Osv.** 

## 6. Libraries & Frameworks
- **Python 3.9+**
- **NumPy** and **pandas** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **scikit-learn** for model building. (annat?)

*(Additional libraries will be added as needed.)*

## 7. Contributing / Team Members
- **Team Members:**
  - Viggo Jahr (GitHub handle: [@amjpg](https://githost.kth.se/AUsername))
  - Axel Prander (GitHub handle: [@BUsername](https://githost.kth.se/BUsername))

## 8. Project Management
- We use the GitHub Issue Tracker to manage tasks, bugs, and new features.
- Milestones are established for each week of the project (Weeks 1-4).
- Each new feature/task is recorded as an Issue and referenced in commit messages.
